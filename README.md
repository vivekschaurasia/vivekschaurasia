<h1>Hi there, I'm <a href="https://vivekschaurasia.github.io/">Vivek Chaurasia</a>ðŸ‘‹</h1>

Iâ€™m a MS in <b>AI student at Rochester Institute of Technology</b> and I specialize in <b>NLP and computer vision</b>. I interned at Stechnova Technology <b>(ML, fine-tuned GPT, 78% satisfaction)</b> and Analysed.in <b>(CV, 10% accuracy boost)</b>. My projects include an <b>AI text detector (88% accuracy, autoencoders), a Passive-Aggressive Email Rewriter (BERT, LLaMA on AWS), a Personalized News Assistant (RAG, 85% accuracy), and an Image Captioning System (BLEU 0.35, TensorFlow)</b>. Skilled in <b>Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and AWS</b>. 


I love exploring AI innovations, coding solutions, and impactful tech. Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re working on something cool or want to collaborate, your support fuels my projects.
